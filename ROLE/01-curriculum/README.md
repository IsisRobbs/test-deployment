- *NOTE:*
  *This course is designed for beginners, meaning learners
  who have had zero to very basic exposure to web development
  and have never or have just started to learn how to program.
  The first half of the course is dedicated to the foundations
  of programming. We highly recommend more advanced learners
  take a close look at the syllabus before demonstrating interest
  in this course (see more details on the following pages).
