## Using Google Fonts

Make sure to create a new branch in this repo for each activity you do inside of it. For instance you could do `git checkout -b google-fonts` for this activity. This will ensure that you don't have issues with the main branch and will keep saved versions of your activities.

## Walk-through

    - Create a new branch if you didn't when you read the above portion.
    - create an html and css document inside of the google-fonts folder.
    - make sure to link your files and then check them in the browser to ensure they are connected properly (you will need to add some sort of styling for this part).
    - in your html file create an `<h1>` and a `<p>` tag and give them some content.
    - Find 2 fonts from https://fonts.google.com/ , one will be used for the "h1" and the other for the "p" tag.
    - Use the `<link>` method for one of the fonts in your html file and the `@import` method for the other font in your css file.
    - make sure you also set the `font-family` property for each element to the font that you have chosen.
    - once you are all done, make sure to add and commit your changes before moving back to the main branch.
